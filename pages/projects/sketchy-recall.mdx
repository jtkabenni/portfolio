SketchyRecall is an Android application developed loosely based on the board game [MonsDrawsity Party Board Game](https://www.geekyhobbies.com/monsdrawsity-party-board-game-rules-and-instructions-for-how-to-play/). The final product is meant to be used in place of a board game, at a party or other in person gathering. We used an AI image generating API called Dezgo to generate a new image based on a randomized prompt at the start of every round. SketchyRecall was originally developed as part of the WWC App Deploy Hackathon.

  Collaborative project with 1Ô∏è‚É£ designer

A random cafe finder for neighborhoods in NYC. Brewlette was born from a discussion amongst friends of the decision paralysis that comes from finding and choosing a cafe to work from in New York City. Created in collaboration with [Amy Sit](https://www.amy-sit.com/), who designed and branded the app.
